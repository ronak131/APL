If you are good at mathematics and engineering, but not good at communication, I would recommend becoming an engineer. 
There are a lot of organizational charts in a lot of companies where the engineers are isolated from the other departments. 
A lot of companies can offer that sort of environment where an engineer can just focus on the problem at hand.
